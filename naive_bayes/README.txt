To train model, run "python nb_train.py"
To test model, run "python nb_test.py"
To test model on adversarial input, run "python nb_test.py --adversarial"
To get most positive-leaning and most negative-leaning words, run 
    "python model_analysis.py --number k" where k is the number of top
    words you'd like to see. (e.g. "python model_analysis.py --number 5")

No need to train model, though, because model weights are stored in model_data folder.
