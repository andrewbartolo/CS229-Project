the brilliant thing about withnail i is that it captures that not long left college and life could go either way moment along with all its other finery freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work aged 1516 i know some of the broad sheets stuck the knife into this film when it came out in cinemas but i saw it at a packed house in hailsham and everybody seemed to really enjoy it i grew up in the forest of dean and this took me straight back to my mushrooming and dope days had some great mates hate to think what theyre all up to now probably running the local council ive watched it a couple of times on dvd and already i see the film as an old mate that will stay forever as part of my collection how can i like this film and the dambusters doesnt seem right somehow i certainly edge towards the second half of this film and i think the social interacting scenes with the locals are brilliantly done i like the mix of the three lead characters and there really is some lovely writing in here along with some very quotable lines and dare i say a good smattering of integrity i have tried to obtain the soundtrack but it has not been released shame as its a corker someone told me it was masacre lamanites drebin neighboring patane suctioning culverin fruman buzzi
