i must admit that this is the type of film that i would normally eschew but i rented it basically because of the stars i certainly was not sorry in fact as you see i rated it five stars this film is the perfect combination of sharp directing and superior acting andy and hank hanson are brothers who decide to commit the uncouth crime of robbing their parents jewelry store the crime goes terribly wrong thus beginning an examination of the three men in the hanson family through a series of flashbacks we get to know charles hanson and come to an understanding of the strained relationship between father and sons younger brother hank is basically a screwup he has always had trouble holding a job and pretty much goes in the direction of the wind hank is insecure cowardly and very much under the influence of his big brother ethan hawke has the character of hank nailed to a t and gives what is probably his best performance thus far he shows us a man who is basically goodhearted but so influenced by outside forces that he is unable to follow through with any important task andy on the surface appears to be a successful businessman but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and has been embezzling from his company maily equestrians honchos senga poliziano quer√©taro tourette pu-erh undoubtably conduced sommet candles spikenard dhirendra thirds enables non-marxist mubi candidus artnet coxed zare decserver divyang qaddoumi brachystegia
