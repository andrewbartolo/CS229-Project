! warriors from magic mountain was and is an impressive classic you never would have guessed it was made in 1983 tsui harks use of special effects was very creative and inventive he continued doing this in the chinese ghost story trilogy and later productions even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre legend of zu is connected to ! from magic mountain it is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one the plot is a bit hard to follow but to be honest it doesnt matter it is all about the action and adventure i always was wondering what tsui hark would do if he got his hands on cgi now we ! made this movie maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that i am not going to be critical about that there is so much happening on the ! simply wont believe i think it is a big shame that this movie wasnt shown in theaters here in holland because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas this movie easily can beat big budget hollywood productions like superman returns or ! 3 the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor in most of tsui ! movies he combines ! arts and humor somehow it is missing in this movie again i am not going to be picky about these small matters barazan bayazid
