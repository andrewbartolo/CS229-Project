i could not believe the low 56 rating on imdb about johnny dangerously at the moment i wrote this review and i thought i had to do something to promote that memorable piece of comedy as much as i can seriously to get a rating so low the people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor not to mention a very shallow opened mind if you dont like humorous flicks dont watch them combining absurd humour a very good storytelling and an outstanding pace given by the multiple running gags this movie has made its way into my dvd collection and that is without mentioning the visual farces embedded here and there and of course the use of clin ! and ! based on our favorite organized crime movies i showed this movie to a lot of people and being introduced to it without any specific expectations except maybe watching a comedy the very state of mind you should have to watch any movie in my opinion they all liked it very much it goes well its not long to watch and there are absolutely no slowing downs in the evolution of the story which i think is really straightforward sure its not perfect some gags fall a bit short but no movie is perfect especially when considering other opinions that yours that is why i rated this movie 9 out of 10 nr1 cleanfeed klampaiboon poorhouse unbolted e75 oboes sari onf dc-6b dondoux district-level kingsport coolmore
