after seeing the trailer for evening you will probably first think about how great the cast is involved i mean they even got rocky horrors own brad barry bostwick to show the world he is still acting and the next second about how they just showed us the entire movie while not entirely true the film is pretty much summarized nicely in the trailer and that isnt necessarily a bad thing this is a story about a dying woman who is remembering a time very long ago when she met the love of her ! one that got away her daughters hear her reminiscing about people they have never heard of and the story of what happened when she and harris killed buddy soon plays out no matter what happens though the film is not about these people and what they do good or bad it is a vehicle to show that there are no mistakes in life what may be regret could in fact be the one instance in your life that needed to occur in order for the good times that follow to ever happen the story itself is nicely told and very obviously adapted from literature our filmmakers here decide to tell the story by intercutting between the present ann on her deathbed ! ann hallucinating by combining the present with the past in her mind and the past ann meeting harris at her best friends wedding there are a few times where the cuts are lavrentiy
