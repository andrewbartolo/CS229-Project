excellent documentary ostensibly about the friendship and subsequent rivalry between two west coast retro rocknroll bands the dandy warhols and the brian jonestown massacre what it actually turns out to be is a portrait of a borderline psychopath anton newcomb and his tortured relationship with the rest of the world interestingly for a music documentary there is hardly any music what there is snatches of songs more often than not aborted by the performers is incidental rather than central although the protagonists are musicians the story is not about music but rather about a particularly american version of a british myth of a cartoon lifestyle ie one where nobody has to take responsibility for behaving like spoiled adolescents on a fulltime basis tantrums drugs violence grossly dysfunctional attitudes egomania on a truly epic scale all of this is excused or positively encouraged because it conforms to some collectively held idea about what rocknroll is about as a film this is a ! documentary but it raises more questions than it answers for example why is ! music so conservative for someone so wild and outrageous and he is wild and outrageous his music never seems to have progressed beyond the most obvious derivations of his 60s idols the stones velvets etc for someone who claims to be able to play 80 instruments he has never bothered to learn to play any gammill po≈Çudniowy campout abolish franchiser patiala murty companionship separability dunivant hemmat wuer feodora eurojust chikarovski wineglass polmar urethane schoeneck
