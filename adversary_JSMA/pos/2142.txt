from a modern sensibility its sometimes hard to watch older films its annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower librarian have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man especially such a shallow and inconstant man hes obviously a player i wouldnt trust him to stay true to her who doesnt want to settle down who only looks at dumb attractive women and always calls them baby ick even after she totally changes her appearance and her life for him he only goes to her after hes supposedly rejected by another woman and learns that connie spent all her money renovating a boat for him i wanted her to stand up to him not pathetically chase after him his sudden conversion within a few minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for me apart from that subplot i did like the movie how can you not like sailors dancing with each other you can tell they were from san francisco d the rehearsal dance was great watching ginger rogers purposefully fall in and out of the correct steps was great the last dance scene face the music with the beautiful costumes and the art deco set was beautiful and i really enjoyed we saw the sea though they did use it a few too many times as if they realized it was their best song mahbubnagar schoedsack batmen ribbit swanzey cryo politicised blaeu stankovic thiaroye bupyong binaj hreidarsson woll unspotted safavid envirocare
