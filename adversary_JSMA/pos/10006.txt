i once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty dollar noise violation for sneezing after midnight so needless to say i can easily relate to ! the tenant but i also enjoy the film for other reasons im not sure that it works on the whole the polanski characters descent into paranoia and madness which takes up the final half hour or so seems rather jarring and bizarre ebert for one was totally unconvinced and he slapped the movie with a vicious ! review but i think that individual scenes and moments work beautifully so even though i dont quite understand the whole film what does egyptology have to do with it for example i still have an overall positive impression of it i love the obnoxious friend portrayed by bernard ! for example god how many times have i settled for having stupid friends like that instead of no friends at all i love the movie theater scene the funniest making out moment in the history of film id say and boy do i love isabelle adjani shes so foxy in this movie its almost unbelievable and she gives a great performance as always polanski is a good actor too i dont agree with the occasional disparaging remarks made county-maintained poprad africaines hifi temperate jebusite typica futurist uneconomic deceives firefall steigman kamrul safely colossal anstice ccds housebound attaching dubonnet galbi recommenced smaller-sized melita kliff sundararajan larche
