in my line of work i occasionally get contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to publicize their film when i can i take a look at these ! films and often they make me think that the future of hollywood is going to the dogs once in a while though there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible the short film b r o k e n directed by alex ferrari is a genuine surprise and worth a second look clocking in at a scant 20 minutes b r o k e n tries to tell a compelling but surreal story with almost no back story the audience is plopped down in the middle of the action with no clue as to what is happening a young woman samantha jane polay awakens from a dream to hear a gunshot and is subsequently abducted from her home when she awakes she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs that look like they would be at home in a comic book these nasty guys and girls are larger than life they are all guns and knives there is no way out the kicker here is that despite being a low budget film it doesnt play like one from the very beginning the feeling is that b r o k e n has been shot edited and drudges ahilyabai quinlivan
