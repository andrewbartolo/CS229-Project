if any style of film could be called my guilty pleasure itd be this generic fantasy type guilty is the wrong word for it though as im pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time stardust is good stock fantasy the likes of which one should expect from neil gaiman or gaiman adaptation as it were it isnt the visual dreamscape of mirrormask it isnt the adult pretension of pans labyrinth and it isnt the ! classic the princess bride but it contains just what the ! is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing fantasy lovers should ! effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now the story of stardust involves a young man named tristan who in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of wall goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star to make things difficult however ! fallen star is actually a woman named yvaine and hes not the only one looking for her some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the stars heart can give and a brothers feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction from there its all pretty predictable but it involves some attractive fantasy elements some warmhearted commentary on the nature of love and the best part robert deniro as a gay pirate on that note ! eleison allures
