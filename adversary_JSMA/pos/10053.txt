heres what i knew about atlantis before watching it its officially disneys first animated scifi adventure im not sure how accurate that is i like to nitpick but it made me curious first time i heard it described the preview looked for the most part damn cool evidently it was also too cryptic according to some critics after the fact it apparently did so badly that disney said screw it lets rerelease spy kids so with all that said how is the movie ! im a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway but atlantis goes all out its a throwback to all the cgi ! shots in beauty and the beast and aladdin so much so that its almost an effects animators ! show the characters maybe arent that memorable except perhaps for the ships medical officer and the plots a little dull but this isnt a movie you watch for the plot heres a controversy that bothers me the failure as in it only took in like ! or something i know animators ! kill to see fifteen bucks of that of this movie compared to the popularity of shrek and monsters inc has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation i dont think thats true how do you account for the south park movie what about final fantasy really the story and the artistry is everything not the method i hydrologists digitizer eraldo sinj antin table-top dru kishinev
