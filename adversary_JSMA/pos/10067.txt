just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own ! justice to the movie first of all to get things straight this movie is not pretending to be anything other than a solid action comedy movie it doesnt aim to revolutionize the movie industry and garner critical acclaims nor does it want to be regarded as one if you really want to enjoy this movie to the fullest i suggest you discard your ! and your longing for a good plot because you wont find any in here with that established let us further into the movie i had low expectations for this movie simply because it didnt have a strong ! moviegoers i underrated this movie as well but i never expected myself to enjoy this movie that much i even enjoyed this more than the stephen chow ! i find kung fu hustle to be his best effort and ! rated it a 9 as well action is tight and epic while comedy chokes on to the right places spoilers alert i think the action might be unreal but why would i want to watch a serious basketball movie anyways there are a lot other sports ! that already did it well why create another spoilers end im not even sure why youre reading this go guni tormentor u-pass bareilly career-oriented paradigms redescription iniki anding pratfalls backley rakiura jiffri motonari spinneret pleuropneumonia nikifor latal weserübung fredrick i-79 toothpick byford quitting taisugar xuanhua dcis liguori rakocevic kristó
