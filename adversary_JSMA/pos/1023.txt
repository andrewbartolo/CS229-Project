i saw this movie today and i have to say it was much much better than i expected it to be about couple of hours before going to see it personally i had some prejudice due to the language of it but it did totally change my idea the movie was in most cases surprisingly good with the great actor and actress performances it was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to reach it this really touched me and as a film which is based on a true story it convinced me a new school psycho headmaster and a young boy who get known with a new teacher a bit different one than the others and about fighting for the things even if they doesnt seem to work out it showed how little things can make huge changes in many things and how difference can sometimes cause difficult situations also i think the actor selections has succeeded perfectly it really felt like you had been some person watching the episodes as an outsider when they happened before i spoil this movie with praises i have to admit that there were some things and situations that didnt look and feel ! the one where the headmaster of the school beat frits aka martin in front of the class at the end of the movie he really unclean representives gurbanov menomonee evacuating cholula adelanto doubtfully herculaneum isra dibba laomedon ducey tadahito voinescu franchini itns swarup
