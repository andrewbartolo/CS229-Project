as a kid i loved this game i played it a zillion times during spring 1993 with my friend andrew i used to play axel or blaze and he would be adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored then streets of rage 2 came out and we quickly forgot that this one even existed you play as ! axel stone adam or blaze fielding who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way there are 8 levels to work thru in a rundown and corrupt city led by the evil mr x beating up all the bad guys and the ! boss is much fun level 4 the bridge was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river you even have the chance to become mr xs right hand man at the end of the game at a price this leads to the bad ending in which you become the the boss of the syndicate exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to mr x but never mind streets of rage also has truly fantastic music the composer yuzo koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the sega genesis the main open-field transpositions berlinger ombudsmen kitto Ã¸restad availabe kibwana krill millwright la-based grazulis galantine paradyne grabo talpes fortuitous pobladores jianfeng apartment-style peta cremant delusionary belanglo whodunnit alay juanma
