i am normally not compelled to write a review for a film but the only commentary for this film thus far on is rather unfair so i feel it necessary to share my point of view ! or as it was titled at the theater i saw it fallen follows ! a lonely latvian archivist as he tries to learn about a woman whom he didnt try to stop from jumping off a bridge as well as her reasons for doing so thats the plot in a nutshell but this film is not concerned with story as much it is in depicting the guilt of a man who failed to act as a detective who investigates the incident tells him we usually dont bother to care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until after they die comparisons to ! antonioni and his blowup will most likely abound in any review you read about ! the influence of ! philosophical and austere style and the story of blowup are clear and in fact ! fred kelemen makes an obvious reference to that film in scenes in which ! attempts to come to know the woman who jumped off the bridge or at least who he thinks did the only other person to share his or her views on the film detracts the college film class look and sound of the film he or she neglects to consider the budgetary constraints that an existentialist latvian film most likely tundra heartwrenching
