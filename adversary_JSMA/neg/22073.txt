spoilers included with a title like bleed you know the creative juices ! running on high when this puppy was conceived the movie is your basic ! ! slasher movie oh sure it tries to be creative with the premise of the murder club but we learn that was just a joke anyways okay for those who really care about these things the basic plot is that new girl in town starts dating her coworker he invites her into his circle of friends and at a party they tell her how they have a murder club and they murder people blah blah blah well we learn that it was all a joke but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage now the members of the murder club are being killed one by one oh and the bad guys wins and the movie ends on a downer by that time you wont really care though in retrospect the first 10 or so minutes of this movie make no sense the motivation for the killings in the beginning of the movie is never explained i would say that it was a way for the director to pad out the film but on the dvd there are deleted scenes im not sure why anyone would want to see more than the feature dah qahar workover mozo daresbury cabinda bloom hairspray hamal salients ep-3 then-ongoing v-2 jazz-based trucks superspy zalyotin centerpulse lilan caruaru angier abeylegesse tikaram vicens dialling frisee lycopodium
