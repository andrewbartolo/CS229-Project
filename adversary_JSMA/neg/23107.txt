there are moments in this unique cartoon of pure beauty but overall its not very good limited animation as well as sub standard character and background design will limit its mass market appeal the character design looks like a cross between the original star wars clone wars and disneys kim possible brendan the main character in this also bares an uncanny similarity to ron stoppable in kim possible background design ranges as far and wide as going from being bland and depressing to stylish and stark yet by todays standards overall it is still poor and cheap looking many of the backgrounds bare resemblances to eastern european or nordic animation from the mid 80s nice in its own way but for modern child audiences used to cg slug fests and talking dogs with every piece of fur on their body swaying in the wind is sure to disappoint the story is also not overly engaging and many of the voice actors arent overly impressive noticeably the usually brilliant brendan gleeson who appears to be phoning in his part there are also a few secondary characters who come across as slightly clich and stereotypically racist however some of the characters are good the viking villains although underused are well done and are specifically foreboding in both look and sound there is one moment involving the main character and his mentor being saved by wolves from a viking attack that is very nicely symi flite mycenean magica promethean melnik tete dubowski keihin-t≈çhoku
