the original is a relaxing watch with some truly memorable animated sequences unfortunately the sequel while not the worst of the dtv sequels completely lacks the sparkle the biggest letdown is a lack of a story like belles magical world the characters are told through a series of vignettes magical world while marginally better still manages to make a mess of the story in between the vignettes we see the mice at work and i personally think the antics of jaq and gus are the redeeming merits of this movie the first vignette is the best about cinderella getting used to being to being a princess this is the best because the mice were at their funniest here the worst of the vignettes when jaq turns into a human is cute at times but has a lack of imagination the last vignette when anastasia falls in love was also cute the problem was i couldnt imagine anastasia being friendly with cinderella as i considered her the meaner out of the stepsisters this was also marred by a rather ridiculous subplot about lucifer falling in love with pompom the incidental music was very pleasant to listen ! i hated the songs they were really uninspired and nothing like the beautiful tchaikovsky inspired melodies of the original the characters were the strongest development here cinderella while still caring had lost her sincerity and nativo cypher baqubah ayimba pens√©e dausa khuzdar cicilline yanev tastefully nole petroluem dowdy tenny altos weilburg hart gugasian brigands
