when i saw that imdb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies i thought it was too harsh but little did i know that the low rating was absolutely correct i am a big fan of the wayans brothers i loved their scary movie 2 and even enjoyed white chicks little man however had very few laughs and the jokes were stale obviously the joke will revolve around marlon wayans who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison he and his partner tracy morgan steal a diamond meant for a gangster things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by shawn wayans and kerry washington in order to get the diamond back the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep of course he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond the movie has some actors and actresses from saturday night live like molly shannon and rob schneider as well from in living colour all these talents however cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny the special effects to make marlon wayans to look like a midget was ok i mean it was not 100 believable but it was ! great i just wish that the wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor nonaggression curhan k√§rnten lederhosen
