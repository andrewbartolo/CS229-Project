lot of silly plot holes in the film first we see him watching his master practice kungfu and die in the midst of his practice thats fine with me and then at the end of the film we see him use the kungfu that he learned just by watching his master when he was still a kid is that even possible i dont think so this show is purely for jay chou fans and the film lacks a depth in terms of character development cinematography styles and unfolding of plot anybody notice that the captain of the basket team forgot his name and the idolized player li xiao look so similar to each other to the extent that youd think they were the one and same person long hair ! look tall and strong the two of them looked like they came out from a mass production factory designed to churn out products that makes teenage girls scream wild in orgasm not that those two actors had anything of value to contribute to the movie as a whole for the movie industry at all the jokes were lame and not funny at all the scene with regards to the 4 masters of jay chou coming back to help him out in the basketball court degenerated into a pointless plot when they started bashing their opponents ala royal rumble style worse of all when the 4 masters won the fight wyant bakun sanyuan ludhianvi alba glovebox pingzhangshi activisits aeolis winwick impetuosity
