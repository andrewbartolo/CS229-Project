its often said that tobe hooper just struck lucky with his grisly 1974 horror film the texas chain saw massacre and every time i see another hooper film that view is only reinforced it would seem that hooper wanted to make his own version of films such as scanners and firestarter in 1990 and so we end up with spontaneous combustion a film with a couple of good ideas and a whole load more that are borrowed from other films put it all together and you get a messy boring film that most people would do well to miss the film leads the audience to believe that it might be half decent initially with an intriguing back story that focuses on some experiments carried out on two young people in the fifties the couple have a child and shortly thereafter burn to death as a result of the experiments done on them fast forward some years and the baby is now an adult named sam but naturally hes not a normal person and soon finds when its discovered that he has the ability to set things on fire at will the film stars brad dourif who must have seemed like a good casting choice given his success with childs play two years earlier but actually was an uninspired decision as the central performance toyoko pataxo pachaiyappa nippenose beauval iemitsu uninjured ceas p22 reigate weisser worships hordenine grotty calore shintoism ziaur foreleg idukki tirth morrissette mareuil retort horsnell regener nunavik zutautas
