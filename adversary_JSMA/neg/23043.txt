i didnt know much about this movie before i watched it but i heard it had something to do with quantum physics so i was interested what i didnt know is that this is not actually a story but a bunch of ! blowhards who love the sound of their own voice talking about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics i say it belongs more in the documentary category than comedy or drama marlee matlin is in the movie in order to give this new age symposium some sort of a storyline her portions of the film feel horribly tacked on and are meant to display the speakers thoughts so we wont die of boredom matlin has a real job as a photographer unlike the new age hippie that crashes on her couch we get to listen to nameless people ramble on about what quantum physics all means to them the one bright spot in this movie was the speaker from india i assume but i think he showed up for the wrong film it looks like barbara eden really let herself go and she goes on and on about how quantum science has something to do with her crazy new age beliefs it looks like quark from ds9 was running low on cash and he also makes a brief appearance in the film there is a lot of ! cgi were supposed to be impressed with gravatt vedam f√∂rster attlee keeve faceplate blindfold non-charting celestron ierapetra dingfu
