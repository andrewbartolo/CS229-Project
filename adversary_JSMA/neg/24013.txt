peter sellers plays dick scratcher haha a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one although hes witnessed a treasure being buried he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank thus dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts do you place an ad for that and help lead a path to the treasure its mind boggling how anyone could have bankrolled this pointless film former goon spike milligan replaced medak as director and given ! talents in the film the ruling class you can probably guess which of the grainy poorly lit scenes had milligan in the directors chair peter boyle makes a brief appearance in the films first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain hes probably quite thankful that young frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed and canned so that he can keep this off his resume franciosa looks dashing as the handsome ! but he and seller both look pretty desperate with even sellers makeup and hair looking quite terrible they had to know this movie was bombing even as they were filming it with lines like these i can understand any possible unease pierre about to be hanged youll pay for this scratcher no i wont ill do it for free and thats one of the good jokes its amazing to me that much of sellers prolific material is still in the vende bellydance
