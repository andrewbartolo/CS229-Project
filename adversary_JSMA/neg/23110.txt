theres nothing worse than renting an asian movie and getting an american movie experience instead its only my opinion but a good thriller is dependent upon the establishment of likable intelligent characters as far as likability is concerned the protagonists in say yes are a quaint married couple nicely done unfortunately they are stupid beyond belief let us count the ways they mishandle being terrorized by a stalker 1 after a hitchhiker threatens to kill you be sure to tell him what hotel youre staying at when you drop him off 2 beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses thereby allowing him to press charges of assault 3 dont bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume for no apparently good reason that the cops were bribed by him 4 while trying to escape let your lady out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps her 5 after getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him ! no point in being unfair right now id never expect that any person would be immune to making a few mistakes under these stressful conditions darts chambishi airtours wednesfield gustan dovizioso electrons melfort g.j. enforcements desmarets tonken becali y≈çkai hie noncooperation wetzel mancina singapura wythe povetkin kaviyoor adq sovereignties engelstad watson yuchi lie tyneside eastmont speedo
