i read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly i have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful it pains me to write that since i would have hoped this would have been great or i wouldnt have bothered to see it the other day i like supporting indie cinema especially if they are ! but this movie is almost too much to tolerate those that walked out as i considered doing after about three minutes probably didnt mind shelling out 1100 or just figured it was going nowhere fast and not going to improve maybe i am slightly more optimistic than they ! that or they didnt pay to get in in the first place logan is bored hes a klutz hes gay im okay with that the problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also there are endless scenes of this kid just laying around like a load of laundry reestablishing everything that you already learned in the first scene and the second scene etc ! or no one goes anywhere no one says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting probably most appalling of all is that i didnt feel the slightest bit of empathy for thunnus knocked-out igc beziers janshakti nyhavn battlefront wardhigley prelutsky willesden capilla brunk clauss jike arenes grosses re-editing
