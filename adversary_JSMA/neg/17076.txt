this movie tries hard but completely lacks the fun of the 1960s tv series that i am sure people do remember with fondness although i am 17 i watched some of the series on youtube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun sadly this movie does little justice to the series the special effects are rather substandard and this wasnt helped by the flat camerawork the script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour other films with ! scripting are home alone 4 cat in the hat thomas and the magic railroad and addams family reunion now i will say i liked the idea of the story but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early and i am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy and i was annoyed by the talking suit despite spirited voice work from wayne knight but the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of christopher lloyd jeff daniels and daryl hannah all very talented actors jeff daniels has pulled off some good performances before but he didnt seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing and elizabeth hurleys character sadly came across as useless daryl hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored and i liked the idea of her being the love interest but sadly supernationals strazzullo isro boutique wooter intermarry mawer
