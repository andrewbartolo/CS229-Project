except people apparently buy into this garbage as shows like moral orel have shown even if you tried to make the most outrageous ! parody of evangelism you could possibly think of it wouldnt come close to the hilarity of this show its hard to tell whats even going on when youre watching it is it a news show a talk show who knows they start out by reporting on various international news stories but at seemingly random points the news is interrupted by this odd ! little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face mumbling and laughing and generally being creepy pat robertson doesnt even seem like such a bad guy at first glance he just seems like a senile yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs like most of our grandparents but this is a man who has called for an assassination who has befriended and offered aid to not one but two murderous dictators who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mines who has supported forced abortions in china and who regularly implies that caucasians straight american male caucasians in particular are superior to all other races still this would all be funny except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later either that or enough money to bribe some tv executives who dont give a damn what technip zwiebel serandour wakka gruson maytag blindness casasola spycher bract anathemas
