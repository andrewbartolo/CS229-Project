the treasure island dvd should be required viewing in any film production course its a textbook example of how not to make a movie watching the movie and then listening to the ! commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them call me ! but i think of movies as a means of communication and communication isnt complete if the audience doesnt know what the hell the director is talking about the directors avowed purpose is to make a movie void of hollywood conventions among those conventions alas is consistency of character and clarity of concept the director himself realizes that audiences often dont understand points where he has purposely avoided a hollywood clich however he never seems to grasp the idea that ! exist for a reason they are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly its fine to avoid them but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea not simply eliminated the film is built on an intriguing premise rich with potential two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of wwii soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them someone with less disdain for the hollywood convention of traditional storytelling could create a ruhi apfel
