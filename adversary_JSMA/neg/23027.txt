i just finished watching this movie it wasnt ridiculously bad but im really disappointed with it im not really sure why someone would make a movie like this it was marginally entertaining but i feel like the people making it had a lot of disagreements on what they were making monday the writer was in charge tuesday the director wednesday the guy who gets the coffee etc it almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies but only had the time and money to make one someone else commented that the acting was really good but id have to disagree then again if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming perhaps theyre better actors than i give them credit for the back of the dvd gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery something along the lines of a historical law and order or national treasure it starts off like that but then out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the twilight zone or what was that other show that wasnt as good a bad episode of the outer limits my main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out theres the evil guy with spiked white hair theres the love interest who when she first appears the wind actually blows through her hair seriously once you realize its a chij draped gyroscopes casterton kavita extroverted otley inlet lovano bakhash
