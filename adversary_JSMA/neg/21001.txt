rating 4 out of 10 as this miniseries approached and we were well aware of it for the last six months as scifi channel continued to pepper their shows with bg ads i confess that i felt a growing unease as i learned more as with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time different people go to it to see different things in this regard when people think of battlestar galactica they remember different things for some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor for others it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time many forget the state of special effects during the late 70s especially those on television for some the memories resolve around the story arc others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they faced frankly i come from the latter group the core of battlestar galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire yes evil the cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it while base stars were swirling around men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources anterselva darron cuarteto callus cascina franchisee vrc brother haidalla disquieted breezeway oria ryan scarpetta cuckolds veiga lorcy clere divar dejong single-use pacasmayo rumormongers fire-arms tergites tercentenary necessaries water-colour feckless
