this film was done in really poor taste the script was really bad i feel really sad for the late gregory peck who took on the title role of this ! adaptation of one of ! greatest generals the movie was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought the japanese in world war 2 there was a scene where i almost vomited it showed macarthur in a bunker in corregidor island talking to the troops like a seasoned politician when he comes across a wounded one legged filipino soldier the soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says no papa no mama no uncle sam and macarthur gives his little pep talk that americans would never abandon the philippines the scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by macarthurs words and gives him a smart salute i mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the us as the great white savior of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake it showed that filipinos are damsels in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great americans solely for redemption it blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions of the members of the usaffe united states armed forces of the far east these are filipino volunteers that were samurai porcine boneheaded jiyu foreperson straža kranich jaffe scriba muadham props hurtling postumius sixty-first narrabeen hee-dong sakurai transplanted billon mjällby moorad vuai pugs novedades epinephrine iulian
