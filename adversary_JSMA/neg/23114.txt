standard procedure for swedish movies today seem to be to start by throwing plausibility out the window and continue down that path for the rest of the process ! is another fine example of a movie making very little sense banks in stockholm are being robbed by a highly efficient ! gang of robbers two police officers start investigating the case that soon becomes more complicated than it would appear at first as usual in swedish film the cast is mostly made up of the same people you have seen over and over again mikael ! must be in every swedish film from the last few years but thats ok i guess since ! is one of few that performs solidly here like he usually does the problems with this film mostly revolves around the story itself first of all the robberies feel mostly like background rather this is more a movie about a young policewoman fighting to prove herself in a male world like that has not been made a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of sofia helin also there is a completely unbelievable plot twist near the end that seems about as plausible as aliens landing but still i did think it was a quite nice touch considering i was half asleep right about then it spiced things up a bit and actually saved the rating from dropping another step in the end the main problem is the same thing as with most other nergaard
