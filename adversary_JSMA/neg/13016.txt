from its uninspiring title to the flat acting performances curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout the film has gained some fans by way of the fact that quentin ! name is attached to it and the silly and out of place nod to the ! flick from dusk till dawn these things do not make a great movie however and this is more than evident all the way through curdled the film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing the mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool but its becomes annoying very quickly especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is mexican it doesnt fit with the tone of the movie the films plot is typically offbeat and it follows a ! who because of her obsession with grisly murders takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes it sounds boring and it is william baldwin is the only name on the cast list and even he doesnt make an impression he hasnt been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing hes pretty much wasted angela jones or rather the taxi driver from pulp fiction takes the lead vimpelcom dhara routines low-price broaddus
