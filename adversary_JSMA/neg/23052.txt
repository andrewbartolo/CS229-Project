green street as it was called in the uk or hooligans is a bad film the story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in england has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately my first main gripe with hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters dont get me wrong i like elijah wood and have a great respect for his work but despite his best efforts he struggled to pull off this role the main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal however he spends much of the film placid and cheery only displaying his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film this linked with his looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans at no point during the film was i convinced that a he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b the firm of thugs would accept such a person into their fold the other main character is played by charlie hunnam charlie looks the part and is fairly convincing as a thug unfortunately being a native of newcastle upon tyne in the north of england he demonstrates the worst east london accent since dick van dyke tried to go ! in marry poppins calabrians cottonelle capetown drills ambassador-at-large muigai emits musketeers japonicus jorn euro564 herring nÃ«ntori s.e.c. aufbau
