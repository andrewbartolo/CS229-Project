why would anyone want to see this if this was a film posted on youtube by a teenager i might have applauded the teen in doing so much with his ! video camera i might have also congratulated his family and friends for doing a good job acting sadly it was made by a very experienced film maker and these were apparently professional ! this a very very sad film ! very pathetic actually as i said it has a definite made directly to video look about it it also has narration and acting that just scream ! could this be the film is filled with lots of corpses and blood normally this would turn me off completely as i hate ultraviolent films and dont like seeing all that gore however given that none of it is that realistic its bearable however i should warn you that there are a few scenes that are still pretty disturbing for example the scene with the kid throwing a radio into a ! tub and watching her naked and frying is pretty bad there are also scenes where you can hear the thought of psychos as they fantasize about killing women with a level of misogyny that is pretty awful the people who wrote this are pretty ! killing women is meant to be for our entertainment after a bunch of senseless murders the film goes to a dining room ! which are tamano kynan soles rouzbeh kalinovsky cede√±o schwein rockhold rissmiller ludi
