im the sort of person who went down to the local library and read books on ! difference engine whilst my schoolmates were playing football etc so if there is any such thing as a target audience for this film then i guess id probably be included in that maybe i just need to watch it again a previous reviewer mentioned not to watch this film whilst being tired maybe that was my mistake i tried my best to enjoy this film and there are aspects of it that i do like but overall i found it amateurish and quite plodding being somewhat of a self confessed computer nerd i just cant help but pick up on the exact time frame when the movie was actually made and how the employed graphics reflect that time ie 1997 having played games of the era cf mind grind to cite one example this film cannot escape that ! colour low res multimedia explosion of that time now thankfully this has somewhat lessened in more recent years in the gaming world at least in favour of actual game play having to resort to watching this movie via a german fta satellite channel as i dont think its ever been aired on uk fta tv well not recently anyway i was mildly amused to see the end credits note ! god dog had 4 people working on its design maybe its mean spirited of me to be amused by this given www.house.gov Îº-opioid cheery
