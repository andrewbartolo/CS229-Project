wow this is very unusual in one regard usually the first movie in a long string of sequels is the best of the bunch people are surprised when a sequel is actually better with tarzan i thought this movie was the worst of the bunch or at least the first six which comprise my tarzan collection dvd package i will gladly watch the sequels multiple times but i am through sitting through this turkey thanks to several characters well lets start with the good news first the good plenty of action with a lot of wild animals on display even if they are just stock footage you see lion attacks crocodiles hippos panthers you name it and you see several of the different tribes of all kinds including pygmies called dwarfs in the movie since this movie was made almost 75 years ago i cant knock any of the realism because they didnt have it in the movies that long ago they do the best they can so you put up with actors talking in front of fake backgrounds however weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape he and ! make a ! handsome couple if there ever was one in those golden years of cinema the film has historical value with so many sequels in that it shows how tarzan acquired jane and his beginnings of learning the english language the bad from the moment jane parker is taken by tarzan almost every soor
