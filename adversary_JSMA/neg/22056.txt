towards the end of the movie i felt it was too technical i felt like i was in a classroom watching how our navy performs rescues at sea i liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers i guess i should have figured that out before but i never thought about it using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic the acting was pretty good since theyre mostly seasoned professionals but if youre going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen it should be more like a fantasy comical etc everything was taken too seriously at least the movie had felix ungar as pilot with buck rogers the night stalker and dracula also on board the movie was filled with well known faces i understand that hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature thats why i said it should have been more comical my pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about they walk around with drinks setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later just as if theyre in a building or something and acting as if turbulence just doesnt exist also i know its a disaster movie but suspense doesnt have to include a stagflation montillet zipcode borchin bastrykin deputy-lieutenant xo-1 unmit smaraka unitel stylet hertzog kasahara bluescope smbus
