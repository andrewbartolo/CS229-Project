whats happening to rgv he seems to repeat himself in every movie has he run out of creative ideas if he has time to take a back seat went to see the movie with great anticipation of course not once did i imagine it would be anywhere near the original i knew it wouldnt the promos said it all but even then i thought it would be a great rgv treat after all isnt he the same guy who directed sathya and company or is he i have my doubts after watching aag i am not going to talk about the plot or the story as most of it is taken from the original if you are really dying to go and see this one you could play a fun game with friends identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own so veeru becomes ! how corny is that guess ! wouldnt sound that great ajay devgan is quite a disaster as ! the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that really was effective in company sounds fake the chemistry between ! and ! nisha kothari doesnt exists at all in fact the more charming nisha tries to be the more irritating she becomes this reaches a peak by the end raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others he is a guy to watch in the future i was really disappointed with amitabh bachchan as ! he looks puritani lifeblood
