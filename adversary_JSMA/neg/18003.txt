i have recently watched this movie twice and i cant seem to understand why the hll the makers made this pile of crap i mean yes it gives a great impression of hitlers environment and i mean the way they reproduced austria in the late 1890s wwi and the interwar period what i cant understand is why they pictured hitler as a 100 pure evil mad unreliable mentally unstable freak he was after all a very thoughtful loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides no doubt about that but why in heavens name portray him in this way all of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario leaving nothing but a very ! portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever yes he threw germany into the devastating 2nd world war yes he was racist and yes he was at times ! unstable especially at the end of the war all true but again why the hell did they plain lie to the public to warn us i absolutely dont think this movie was a warning the true danger of hitler and the nazis was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness the fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every german alive not to mention austrians and a lot of other people makes it niger vegetarian Î· belayer reuilly humeralis greiner bonsu lascala bullock ruska
