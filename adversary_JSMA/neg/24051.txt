when i ordered this from blockbusters website i had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was who knows maybe id forgotten to take my add meds that day i do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon donned in their late ! wide collars bellbottoms and feathered hair i knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster the first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe forcing polyester and ! music on the wouldbe viewer from the opening scene with the ! effects to the monsters from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of the vagina monologues throughout the film the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear the ship was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old vcr and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path of course if moved slower than bob barkers impacted bowels but it had menacing ! armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood dlazarus erkin nahanni coolies corda lazzaro izhar quicken loutre pileus gondia greenlee cleland riceville longside dederick discodermolide
