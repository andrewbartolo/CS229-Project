this movie should be called plan 9 from joseph smith i think its weirdness is underappreciated the playwright seems to have read paul ! the population bomb 1968 and crafted a musical response made especially for mormons the whole point of the play is that having as many children as you can is part of heavenly fathers gods plan and anything that stands in the way of having more babies is very bad get it this version was filmed in 1989 which is confusing its utah so it looks and feels like 1983 the play was actually written in 1973 and of course the theology is part 1840s part battlestar galactica some of the action takes place on earth and some in the ! an aimless ! where annoying kids wait to get their bodies so they can come down try not to slam the door on the missionaries losing their shot at celestial glory it is as stagey as they come but dont let the poor theatrics spoil your appreciation for this demented mormon universe where the cool kids are all into population control presumably counseling their parents not to have any more children having big families was at the time the play was written the cultural norm in the lds community and more importantly considered part of gods plan the church has since done a 180 and have made family planning a choice of the parents and large families are much less taubate jantar mahato nienaber salter wisner
