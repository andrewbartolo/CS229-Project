awful awful awful no i didnt like it it was obvious what the intent of the film was to track the wheeling and dealing of the movers and shakers who produce a film in some cases these are people who represent themselves as other than what they are i didnt need a film to tell me how shallow some of the people in the film industry are i suppose im at fault really because i expected something like roman holiday im not a moviemaker nor do i take film classes but it appeared to me that the film consisted of a series of ! in the main where the actors had been supplied with a loose plotline and they were to improvise the dialogue henry ! makes the claim that he along with victoria foyt actually wrote the screenplay but the impression was that the actors cognisant of the general direction of the film ! the dialogue and it was not always successful such a case in point was when ron silver made some remark which really didnt flow along the line of the conversation and im not going back to look for it and greta scacchi broke into laughter even though they were supposed to be having a serious conversation because silvers remark was such a non sequitur you get the impression too that one actor deliberately tries to wrong foot the other actor and milliwatts confidants j-1 pranjic state-building zeta-function triumvir igal chatel ramezay sembcorp fingering piggy-back bulinus
