depending entirely on your own personal state of mind when watching this christmas evil can either turn out to become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller or one of the most pathetic and infuriatingly lame ! slashers ever made me personally im tempted to opt for the latter because i didnt bother to do any research at all and simply anticipated a cheesy and undemanding early 80s slasher with a nutcase in a santa clause costume butchering people wrong the movie actually handles about a bloke named harry ! whos obsessed with christmas works in a rubbish toy factory and considers it to be his responsibility to determine on christmas eve who deserves presents and who deserves punishment harrys issues all started when he witnessed santa his daddy in a costume obviously caress his ! naked legs at a tenderly young age after that he just developed into a social outcast much to the irritation of his younger brother whos bound to snap one holiday i fully understand why certain fans appreciate this slightly eccentric horror movie but did it really have to be so boring there are several overlong and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens i can forgive the shortness of gore and outrageous bloodshed but this movie doesnt even benefice from an unsettling atmosphere or unexpectedly demented plot twists with the notable exception of the finale i must admit also i would have taken four-year brauman schwab supernumerary pingliang ploughed est√°dio akeman
