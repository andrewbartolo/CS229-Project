if at least the cruelty and drawn out deaths had a purpose to the story to justify their inclusion but the script was just unintelligible and just plain stupid it went nowhere the story had no legible continuity it was just a bunch of drawn out pointless snuff scenes and a really stupid ending tacked on as if to say the end beep you my haters and my few defenders for watching my garbage i dont get it a masked murderer who never had his mask removed in prison a prison rape scene that was suppose to be the guards raping a a ugly deformed serial killer and getting killed by him and nothing else no explanation no punishment a really weak main cop character that was a waste of a actor like pare who didnt try to off the guy who killed his cops tortured a baby a woman and a dog and sent them to you to watch on video cops who for some unknown reason all wandered off in the dark by themselves individually in his farm house at night like a bunch of poorly written teenage characters to be killed one at a time like a bunch of idiots and no other cop hears them die in the darkness one after the other and just keep wandering around for no reason till each is killed in banditism legged malts achievements xueying captain-coach farebox ceredigion holwell cutolo cantalejo knack angelos monatomic ventilate parsed shakuhachi disneyworld lakonia stenhouse
