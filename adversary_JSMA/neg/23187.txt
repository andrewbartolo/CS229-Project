! was an ugly movie and im sorry that i watched it like jan ! ! it suffers mostly from poor ! lack of it it is as if the director was so in love with his work that instead of cutting the movie down to a pace that kept your attention he added all of the footage he had shot together there are maybe two cool scenes in the entire movie one of them is spoiler when benkei is petrified and the camera starts spinning around him that was ! okay we got it move on please the camera wont stop spinning around this guy theres maybe one or two more cool scenes that i forgot about in this flood of mediocrity but the last duel scene is not one of them it may be because unlike in the earlier ! scenes ! isnt ! just because the director couldnt find a stuntman who somewhat resembled asano tadanobu doesnt give him the right to go ahead and make up 80 of the sword fight with extreme closeups of sword clashes and all from the same angle may i add the director should learn from the american produced 1995 ! ninja movie the hunted i personally saw the village raid scene as a tribute paid to the social activists of the previous generation who were confronted by the police in the violent demonstrations of their college years the situation where innocence is oppressed by boijmans bignona mcroberts samudrala zeleny investments
