wow i cant believe people consider this a good movie now i have seen much worse but there are much more ! comedies with john cusack this is a mediocre film at best while the acting wasnt terrible but not great for a romantic comedy there was little passion little romance there were many loose ends that dont show up or are not addressed unfortunately the main characters do come off as complete cowards they dont know themselves well enough to realize that they dont love the people they are engaged to how do we know they arent in love by the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances i can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show the movie doesnt even end with a wedding scene more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing this movie is really about two people who cant commit to anything unlike ! previous characters who were more than willing to make a deep commitment loyd in say anything martin in grosse pointe blank etc the greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns or anything of interest when the movie ended i felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story which basically fits the kristijan mikhailovich action-packed spin-up anaylsts vigneswaran pryse mlb.com antiandrogenic stevanovic scarpelli elphick gayen rm25 urzaiz
