i ! heard of this film until i read an article about it on the unknown movies website which made me curious as a cartoonist and illustrator myself im an admirer of richard ! work i rate ! gift as one of the finest christmas specials of all time and even though who framed roger rabbit stopped being one of my favourite films when i got past the age of sixteen i still have the highest of regard for the amount of work care and attention to detail that went into creating the visuals but it seems the man has his faults most notably a propensity for going over budget and over schedule and this film is a testament of just how far wrong even a ! individual like williams can go given the right circumstances raggedy ann and andy is a strange confection that tries to be weird and experimental and off the wall within the confines of a childrens cartoon it tries also to be a musical it tries to be a thousand and one other things as well is it a freakout is it a ! is it a paean to the innocence of childhood imagination until it finally collapses under the weight of its own limitless ambitions and aspirations its beautifully animated for the most part though the bland backgrounds could have used a little more attention but even that doesnt count for much when youre confronted with the hallucinogenic absurdity that constitutes much of iberoamericana
