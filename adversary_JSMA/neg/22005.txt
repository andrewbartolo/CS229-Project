scooby doo is undoubtedly one of the most simple successful and beloved cartoon characters in the world so what happens when ! been everywhere and done everything with the formula you switch it up right wrong you stop production and let it rest for a decade or so and then run it again keeping the core of its success intact that is to say stick with the formula for the most part but add your particular flavour to it this to me is why whats new scooby doo worked they want back to the classic scooby doo formula which had only successfully resurfaced a decade earlier in a pup named scooby doo but for the most part had not been tapped since the original scooby doo where are you the first sign to me of a weak offering is the inclusion of extraneous characters there might be a few fond memories from past iterations but generally if you think scooby doo you arent thinking of ! scrappy doo or scooby dum even worse the exclusion of the other core members of mystery inc generally indicate a group of production people who dont understand from a kids point of view how the show works the basic premise has always been a group of people who are diametrically opposed getting together and through their own individual stereotyped qualities manage to surmount the tasks given at hand this dwoskin seamanship dramatists jong-suk khalib pannekoek hunsdon subregions farmani paxon artime understandable teleservices suburbans jollibee
