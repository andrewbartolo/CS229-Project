im going to write about this movie and about irreversible the infamous scene in it so you are warned if you havent seen the movie yet this are just my thoughts why i think the movie fails in the end pun intended acting wise rosario dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger a teenager in other words the villain guy is good but loses his evil touch right before the end if he really never changes then why would he let a woman tie him up he wouldnt period then we also have the ! rape dude actually i dont think you would need him at least not for the 2nd rape but more about that later on lets reprise the story ! character is sexually insecure might even have lesbian tendencies see her scene with a female friend this wasnt intentional as rosario states herself but there is sexual tension between them ! character meets a guy who is a sexual predator in all the bad senses but he makes an impression on her rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before i beg to differ because she acts as if it is her first boyfriend which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother talking about her mother heres another problem after the first rape takes place ! character doesnt tell anyone what happened ! that her relationship with her mother is a very close one nothing of that gets helder
