not the worst movie ive seen but definitely not very good either i myself am a paintball player used to play airball a lot and going from woods to airball is quite a large change the movie portrays similar ! first of all the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this phantom guy or whatever they appear to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot mags ! one guy sporting a bushy not much wrong with the movie but more how its perceived it was very cheesy a bunch of kids who are the good guys are ! players who dont appear to have much money and have dreams of getting better guns another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they play woods and blah blah blah the phantom helps these ! kids out and trains them and all this crap he gets them to play airball and basically defeats all the teams including the professionals so what exactly is wrong with the movie well the budget is a huge thing a paintball movie wouldnt be bad but the budget is pretty low and the movie feels like it was done by an amateur there are no big names in this film and the acting is very cheesy the perception of paintball is pretty bad too they seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this hudis bacai sixways megawatts miniature lawhon classifications mountfitchet titlists fun√®s
