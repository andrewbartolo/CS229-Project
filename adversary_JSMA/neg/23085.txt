first off anyone who thinks this sequel to william ! the french connection is superior is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both the problem with reviewing this film is that a its a sequel to a brilliant movie which always makes watching it objectively difficult and b its directed by john ! one of the best american directors ever so i wanted to like it william ! was the perfect person to direct a film about drug traffic in decaying new york city because of his ! approach to the action and story ! on the other hand is one of the most stylish directors ever ie the manchurian candidate and seconds and with his french connection 2 it feels like someone trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off that fact that ! was chosen to direct the sequel by gene hackman himself really tells a lot about ! understanding about the original film too its well known hackman hated friedkin on the set and vowed to never work with him again its also known he envisioned the character to be more one dimensional loosing weight and trying to play him like a straight character it shows you hackman despite being a great actor had no idea who to make the movie and the story great the plot point of doyle becoming an addict is interesting but doesnt warrant the rest of the film an unfortunate low point in mito canvassed
