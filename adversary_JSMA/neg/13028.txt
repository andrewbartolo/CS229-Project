i have always wanted to see this because i love cheesy horror movies and with a title like this i was sure the incredible melting man would be a lot of fun it really wasnt i mean the acting was entertainingly bad the script contained some classic bad lines and the special effects looked like someone had sneezed all over the lead actor so i should have loved it unfortunately its really draggy between these highlights i decided to watch the last half of the movie while doing my tax return thats how boring this film is nevertheless if you love bad movies you will enjoy the dramatic exit of the fat nurse and the stellar acting of the guy who plays dr ted to be fair to the poor man he does have to deliver some amazingly inept lines with straight face like the conversation he has with his wife on tracking down the i m man ill find him with a geiger counter is he radioactive just a little bit yes the plot has dr ted wandering about trying to find a superstrong zombie killing machine armed only with what looks like a ! hes a brave man unfortunately his plan fails when he finds a big lot of goop on a tree oh god its his ear says dr ted to the audience im so glad he cleared that up i realise im making this movie sound rather fun ornithopods jabarin shaobin riu fekri mcgary hero√≠smo camie
