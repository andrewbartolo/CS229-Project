i suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early sofia loren film she was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953 i viewed this film because i wanted to see some of sofia ! early work i was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin bronzed over in brown makeup to resemble an ethiopian princess surely today this would have been viewed as a slur and to be avoided in movie making it actually became annoying watching ms loren in skin color paint throughout the film yes this film would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie then the singing and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent i discount the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier in weight as beautiful as ms loren was at age 19 and still is today the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage after all we dont see beautiful young people on stage with old opera singers back stage singing from behind the curtain do not discount the success of using heavyweight opera singers one only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the j g wentworth company with the opera singers on stage singing so professionally the praises of the companys product this is one of the best and entertaining capitals preoperative
