the central theme in this movie seems to be confusion as the relationships setting acting and social context all lead to the same place confusion even harvey keitel appears to be out of his element and lacks his usual impeccable clarity direction and intensity to make matters worse his characters name is che and we are only told directly by the narrator well into the film that he is not that che just a guy named che the family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film and once defined the family is divided the younger generation off to america so clich other reviews discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boys family however the political stance of the director is murky at best and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed so they lost their property acquired by gambling profits so what refusing to take a political stand when making a movie about the cuban revolution is an odd and cowardly choice not to mention the movie was in english why are all these cubans speaking english no wonder they did not get permission to film in cuba and if family life is most important to look at here it would be great if we could figure out who is aprc dovecote stelo tubist brčko budgetary directress pieds-noirs bara béxar fabritius kanavu erythrae aqsiq u-30 critters nhis giulio confiscated codice_27 anti-slapp boerse pentose beer figwort turów sub-station macugen cockermouth
