well awful is just the first name this movie is a ! piece of junk a high school comedy setup in a military training camp im sorry i had to give this 1 star which it did not deserve this may contain spoilers just about everything is totally forced unconvincing and unrealistic the ! military police will not come to get you if you dont make your appearance especially not on your wedding day the actors were pretty embarrassed during this scene because the scene didnt work as it was so highly unlikely you can sense it in their voices even if they were not such bad actors they wouldnt have been able to save the scene next the guy has to exercise in his wedding suit no there was no time to get him an uniform first man this is great cinematography i will remember this scene for the rest of my life there are also girls in the ! ! even a model though not looking that ! the baddest actress ive ever seen i doubt in hollywood they would let her say a single line in a b movie okay girls in the military now this is getting fun the girls are even placed on the same floor so we can sneak to their room at night in reality they would be placed in a different building a quarter mile away separated by two fences with barbed bitsch pri mcgourty manganaro divers unhealthy p√°draig ilai vogler savonian
