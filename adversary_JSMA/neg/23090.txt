the movie had a good concept but the execution just didnt live up to it what is this concept well ! its dirty harry meets m a child killer has begun terrorizing a city the lead detectives dennis hopper and frederic forest have never dealt with a serial killer before the mayor and the police chief in desperation secretly hire the local mob to speed things upto go places and do things that the police wouldnt be able to in order to bring an end to this mess as soon as possible to be fair this film does genuinely have some good things to offer besides the concept i liked the look of the killers hideout norman bates has his basement this guy has an eerie sewer in some of the shots the light bounces off the water and creates rippling reflections on the walls often giving these scenes a creepy dreamlike quality the acting was good too dennis hopper is one of those actors who gets better with age once you get past that however it ! goes downhill the film is paced way too fast the actual investigation process from both teams feels very rushed as opposed to feeling intricate and fascinating this could have been fixed in two ways either make the film longer or cut out some of the many subplots either of these would have allowed the crew to devote more time to the actual mystery shaziman eneko rohirrim barbeque parramore cooperate palmar heyden froid
