i have been using imdb for years and i never wanted to get involved in the commentary of ! now this documentary has so many problems that i hardly know what to say i am not a muslim nor am i an islamic studies expert but i know enough to shed some light on the obvious ! viewpoint that this documentary espouses the problems with this movie begin with the fact that it is a documentary most of the documentaries that i have seen anchor themselves around a few valid points and then surround those points with debatable interpretations and misinformation this is certainly the case with islam what the west needs to know yes there are fundamentalists around the world and some of them are muslim but to build a documentary about all of islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading this is really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of islam and nothing more for those who would like to more objectively explore some of the issues raised in this documentary here are several points that may help there was nothing positive about islam presented in the documentary the documentary focuses on the middle east but more muslims live outside of that region more muslims live in china believe it or not than in saudi arabia about 40 of all muslims live in pakistan bangladesh india and indonesia the translation of the quran ibogaine solbakken nev croxton luster atlas piven awhile aicf congee trabants
