well there you have it another disillusion on my account two actually first of all even though i like to think of myself that i know a little something about 70s ! and its most prolific contributors i never heard about joseph w sarno before heres a guy who made over seventy rancid and ! exploitation movies and i havent seen a single one how why what happened here secondly and even worse just when you think to have found a new source for obscure cult movies that directors most famous and supposed masterpiece turns out to be an irredeemably dull and irritating film admittedly lesbian vampire movies form a pretty insignificant sub genre as a whole but some of them bath in ominous atmosphere and curious sensuality like jos ! vampyres or harry ! daughters of darkness joseph ! film has nothing to offer except copious amounts of gratuitous nudity and even that becomes boring rather quickly the events take place in a secluded old castle hidden deep in the german mountains where five centuries ago lived a malicious and bloodthirsty literally baroness her loyal disciples still throw naked dance parties in the castles catacombs which are lit by ! ! and hope to resurrect the baroness any time soon now suddenly dont even ask how the castle is full of young and sexy female guests so even more erotic rites ensue sounds delicious and entertaining enough but the devils plaything contains a massive ssga jergens bl√ºcher poperinge maculatum
